**Program Description: Birthday Database**

This Python script is a simple birthday database that stores names and birthdays in a dictionary. The program runs in an infinite loop, prompting the user to enter a name or leave the input blank to quit. Based on the user's input, the program performs the following actions:

1. **Check if the name is in the dictionary**: If the user enters a name that is already in the dictionary, the program prints the corresponding birthday.
2. **Add a new birthday to the dictionary**: If the user enters a name that is not in the dictionary, the program prompts the user to enter the birthday and adds it to the dictionary.

**Example Use Cases:**

* Enter a name that is already in the dictionary: The program prints the corresponding birthday.
* Enter a name that is not in the dictionary: The program prompts the user to
